# Hey, I'm Alex Andru!

## Software, GenAI, and fun

### A few short tidbits about me:
I am passionate about the intersection of business and technology. 
I love product, but live by the mantra of "If you want something done properly, do it yourself".
I've been coding since 12 years old, and somehow I'm still coding...
In my free time, I love to dabble in Mechanistic Interpretation.
Obsessed with building and learning.
I like Typescript. I like Rust. I like Go. I like Python. I... I like to code in general.
### Author of MCP-Framework, mcp-docker, mcp-mongo, mcp-jira, mcp-filesystem and the lmao-lang programming language... and some other junk

### Community Manager for r/modelcontextprotocol and the MCP Discord - the #1 spot for mcp discussion and insight
